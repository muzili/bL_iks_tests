big.LITTLE switcher test suite
------------------------------

This test suite has been developed by Linaro. The goal of this test suite is
to test big.LITTLE switching functionality and stress tests. The main focus
is to test big.LITTLE switching while system switches it cores from A15 to A7
and vice versa. It is compatible for both Android and Ubuntu.

In the Package
--------------

Here is a short description of what is included in this package
Android.mk
        Android make support file
android-prebuilts/*
        Holds android pre-built ARM binary file bl-agitator. which will be
        used by other test scripts for switching testcases.
basic/*
        Collections of basic big.LITTLE test
bl-agitator/*
        big.LITTLE agitator build support files
boot-a15
       This script ensures the given cores are running on a15
boot-a7
       This script ensures the given cores are running on a7
cache-coherency-switcher
        Test script to test cache-coherency among switching cores
cpu_freq_vs_cluster_freq
        Test script to test cpu freq in a given cluster should match with all
        cpus belongs to the same cluster.
data-corruption
        Test case is to test data corruption with the help of md5sum
data-corruption-switcher
        This file is a collection of date corruption, random and periodic
        switch test cases.
disk-io-stress-switcher
        This file is a collection of iozone, random and periodic switch test
        cases.
vfp-ffmpeg
	This file is to test vfp feature in kernel by using ffmpeg tool.
vfp-ffmpeg-switcher
	This file is to test vfp feature in kernel by using ffmpeg tool
	while random and periodic switching happens.
install-scripts-android.sh
        To install pre-built testcase on to MMC
interactive-governor-test.sh
        This test sets the interactive, or ondemand governor as appropriate,
        and uses a tool to create stress on the system, and make sure that
        the system automatically responds by moving cpus over to big, then
        back to little when it's done. 
Makefile
        To make and install
mem-stress-switcher
        This is pre-built binary memtester along with bigLITTLE switcher
README
        This document
run_stress_switcher_tests.sh
        A simple shell script to run all the test in sequence and report the
        overall results
perf-count-events
        Test to count the perf events on clusters A7, A15 and switcher mode.
        
Usage information
-----------------

These test cases would be available along with linaro development images of
Ubuntu and Android.
